# Braq's Items
A big ol' mod adding a variety of new items. Currently just a handful designed to synergize with eachother.

## Tier 1
#### Accelerant
Increases <damage>explosion radius</damage> by <damage>5%</damage> <stack>(+5% per stack)</stack>.

## Tier 2
#### Inert Bomblet
Explosions scatter up to <damage>3<damage> <stack>(+2 per stack)</stack> bomblets, each dealing <damage>50%</damage> TOTAL damage within 50% of the radius of the original explosion.

## Tier 3
#### My Manifesto
<dDamage>Hitting 5 enemies</damage> with <damage>1</damage> explosion sends you into a <damage>frenzy</damage> for <damage>6s</damage> <stack>(+4 per stack)</stack>. Increases explosion radius by <damage>100%</damage>, and all explosions <damage>ignite</damage> for an additional <damage>50%</damage> total damage. Has a cooldown of <utility>10s</utility>.


Big thanks to TheMysticSword, who's item mod I heavily referenced to understand the codebase: https://github.com/TheMysticSword/MysticsItems
And thanks to the contributers of the R2Boilerplate, who saved me writing boring code so I could get to writing fun code: https://github.com/risk-of-thunder/R2Boilerplate
