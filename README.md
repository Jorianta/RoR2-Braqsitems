A basic mod implementing a new lunar item:

IMPERMANENCE
Gain a chance to recieve bonus items from chests BUT you have a time limit each stage.

Big thanks to TheMysticSword, who's item mod I heavily referenced to understand the codebase: https://github.com/TheMysticSword/MysticsItems

And thanks to the contributers of the R2Boilerplate, who saved me writing boring code so I could get to writing fun code: https://github.com/risk-of-thunder/R2Boilerplate
